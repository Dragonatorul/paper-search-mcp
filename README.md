## Overview

`paper-search-mcp` is a Python-based MCP server that enables users to search and download academic papers from various platforms. It provides tools for searching papers (e.g., `search_arxiv`) and downloading PDFs (e.g., `download_arxiv`), making it ideal for researchers and AI-driven workflows. Built with the MCP Python SDK, it integrates seamlessly with LLM clients like Claude Desktop.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Source Support**: Search and download papers from arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, and Sci-Hub (optional).
- **Standardized Output**: Papers are returned in a consistent dictionary format via the `Paper` class.
- **Asynchronous Tools**: Efficiently handles network requests using `httpx`.
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with MCP clients for LLM context enhancement.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new academic platforms by extending the `academic_platforms` module.

## Installation

You can install `paper-search-mcp` using either `pip` or `uv`. Below are detailed instructions for both methods.

### Using pip

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paper-search-mcp.git
   cd paper-search-mcp
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install -e .
This installs the package in editable mode, including requests, feedparser, httpx, and fastmcp.
Verify Installation:
bash
python -c "import paper_search_mcp; print(paper_search_mcp.__version__)"
Should output 0.1.0 (or your current version).
Using uv
uv is a fast, modern Python package manager. Here's how to use it:
Install uv (if not already installed):
bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Restart your terminal after installation.
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paper-search-mcp.git
cd paper-search-mcp
Set Up Project:
bash
uv init  # Initialize uv project (if not already done)
uv venv  # Create virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
Add Dependencies:
bash
uv add -e .
This installs the project in editable mode with all dependencies.
Verify Installation:
bash
uv run python -c "import paper_search_mcp; print(paper_search_mcp.__version__)"
Testing
To ensure the server works correctly, run the included unit tests.
Activate Environment:
With pip: source .venv/bin/activate
With uv: source .venv/bin/activate
Run Tests:
bash
python -m unittest discover tests
test_arxiv.py: Tests the ArxivSearcher class.
test_server.py: Tests the MCP server tools (search_arxiv and download_arxiv).
Expected Output:
```
....
Ran 4 tests in X.XXXs
OK
- Tests will search for 10 papers and download them to `./test_downloads`.
Troubleshooting:
Network Errors: Ensure you have an active internet connection.
Permission Denied: Run as administrator or change save_path in test_server.py.
Usage
Running the Server
Start the MCP server locally:
bash
python -m paper_search_mcp.server
The server runs with stdio transport, ready to accept MCP client connections.
Using with Claude Desktop
Install Claude Desktop:
Download from Anthropic's website and install the latest version.
Configure MCP Server:
Open or create ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json (Mac) or equivalent path (Windows/Linux).
Add the server configuration:
json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "paper_search_server": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "paper_search_mcp.server"
            ]
        }
    }
}
Save and restart Claude Desktop.
Verify Integration:
In Claude Desktop, look for the hammer icon (ðŸ”¨) in the UI.
Click it to see available tools (search_arxiv, download_arxiv, etc.).
Example Commands
In Claude Desktop, try these commands:
Search Papers:
Search for "machine learning" papers on arXiv
Returns a list of 10 papers (default max_results).
Download a Paper:
Download arXiv paper 2106.12345
Saves the PDF to ./downloads (default path).
Custom Search:
Search PubMed for "cancer treatment" with max_results=5
Returns 5 papers from PubMed.
Deployment
Local Deployment
For personal use or development:
Run Continuously:
bash
nohup python -m paper_search_mcp.server &
Keeps the server running in the background.
Logs:
Check nohup.out for server output.
Cloud Deployment
To deploy on a cloud service (e.g., AWS EC2):
Set Up EC2 Instance:
Launch an Ubuntu instance.
Open port 22 (SSH) and ensure internet access.
Install Dependencies:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paper-search-mcp.git
cd paper-search-mcp
pip3 install -e .
Run Server:
bash
python3 -m paper_search_mcp.server
Use screen or tmux to keep it running after logout:
bash
screen
python3 -m paper_search_mcp.server
# Press Ctrl+A, then D to detach
Access:
Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to connect via SSH tunnel or expose the server publicly (not recommended without security).
Security:
Add authentication (e.g., API key) in server.py if exposed publicly.
